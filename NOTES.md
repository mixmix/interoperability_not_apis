APIs are not an emergin tech, they've been around for decades.
Govt moving into APIs is awesome, and _take the learning from the failures of the web_

APIs enable a lot of sweet things, but the killer feature is INTEROPERABILITY

No web platforms are current interoperable.
  - at best you can log in with one identity in multiple places
  - you don't have the data you need across locations 

Data centric
People centric


- bank analogy
  - people
  - computers

- problem with bank api
  - me making kiwibank api

  - my ASB mortgage
  - my kiwibank

  - silo'd
    - multiple identities
    - jealous companies
